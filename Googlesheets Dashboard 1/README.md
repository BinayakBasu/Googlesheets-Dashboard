**I have used the Superstore sales data for creating an Interactive dashboard in Googlesheets. I have modelled the Dashboard in such a way that it provides insights about the important metrics with respect to sales based on several parameters and their combinations.**

**The following concepts have been used to model this interactive Dashboard in Googlesheets**
1. Data Validation Techniques
2. Conditional Formatting
3. Query Language 
4. Google charts
5. Sparkline 
6. Pivot Table
